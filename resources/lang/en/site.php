- providing tools for adding content, organizing collaboration on content; <br/>

- process management: sending email, sending documents; <br/>
- display of the current statuses of the organization and selected nodes; <br/>
- publishing content; <br/>
- presentation of information in a form convenient for navigation, search. <br/><br/>
The control system can contain a wide variety of data: documents, films, photos, phone numbers, scientific data and so on. Such a system is often used to store, manage, review and publish documentation. Version control is one of the important features when content is changed by a group of people. <br/><br/>
In general, content management systems are divided into corporate content management systems (Eng. Enterprise Content Management System) - to work with content within any organization and a web content management system (Eng. Web Content Management System) to support the operation of the website. <br/><br/>
In other words, a site system can have both internal and external components. The internal part of the site system is available to employees within the enterprise, and the external one is available to all users of the site. <br/><br/>
Some 3 years ago, the main problem for implementing site systems in most enterprises was the high cost of boxed solutions with reduced functionality and the need to deploy them based on our own infrastructure. With the advent of cloud-based (SaaS) solutions, such a problem, even for a small company, has ceased to be relevant. <br/><br/>
The use of such technological solutions in the work is beneficial for both small and large businesses. And if you are interested in what benefits this can provide to the business owner, read on. <br/><br/>
The platform provides a wide range of tools for organizing the effective work of almost any business: <br/><br/>
- adding projects, setting and tracking tasks on them; <br/>
- management of sales, commercial offers and other operations; <br/>
- sales funnel and lead processing; <br/>
- a disk for storing documentation and files; <br/>
- separation of access rights and roles; <br/>
- integration with the site and online store; <br/>
- live chat between company employees; <br/>
- contacts, records, reports and more. <br/><br/>

- entrance to the site (registration, authorization); <br/>
- user\'s personal account; <br/>
- the administrative part of the site (user management), etc. <br/><br/>
This standard set of components is complemented by the logical parts of a particular enterprise, reflecting the individual characteristics of the client. Our experts can easily select and program them into a convenient user interface, and more simply, intuitively connected to the pages of the site. Our experience is based on the best examples and practices of other similar sites. We use the latest technology to develop it. <br/><br/>
At the same time, the disadvantage of free systems is the lack of the ability to modify them for business purposes. <br/><br/>
An organization can afford a website system designed for its business goals, and our programmers are able to implement all the wishes and wishes of the customer. <br/><br/>
When choosing a site system, you should pay attention to such details as: <br/><br/>
- safety; <br/>
- the ability to refine the elements; <br/>
- a set of features and capabilities; <br/>
- the convenience of working with headings, meta tags and other details important for promotion; <br/>
- the ability to create your own names for pages and semantic URLs; <br/>
- speed of work; <br/>
- the presence of Russian-language localization; <br/>
- lack of third-party elements (for example, advertising banners not provided by you); <br/>
- the ability to handle errors; <br/>
- lack of duplication of pages; <br/>
- site map support; <br/>
- the convenience of adding and deleting pages, etc. <br/><br/>

                service or product, which improves the effectiveness of advertising. <br/> <br/>

                Visitors get to the landing pages of the site through contextual, banner, targeted advertising and
                email newsletter. The main task of landing sites is the conversion of visitors into a lead or a buyer, the motivation of a visitor
                to commit the target action. Such an action may be: purchase, subscription to newsletter, registration on the site,
                downloading the information provided, sending the visitor’s contacts. <br/> <br/>

                Unlike the site, the landing page doesn’t include links where the user can leave the page, since there is no personal account.
                All links lead either to landing elements - informational parts, or to the contact form. <br/> <br/>

                The purpose of the landing is to focus the user on one offer (a specific service or product). Because the whole
                Landing information aims to sell this product or service. It uses one key call to action.

                This condition is necessary for effective landing and coverage on the Internet. Do not allow visitors to leave the landing without committing
                target action. In order to prevent this from happening and to minimize the possibility of implementing such a scenario, you need to remove everything from the landing page

                An online store is primarily useful to owners of standardized goods and services.
